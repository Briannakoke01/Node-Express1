# Broken App Issues

## 1. Missing `async`/`await`
- **Problem**: The original code likely lacked `async`/`await`, resulting in incomplete or missing data responses.
- **Fix**: Wrapped GitHub API requests in `async` functions and used `await` to handle asynchronous data fetching correctly.

## 2. Lack of Input Validation
- **Problem**: No validation for the `developers` field, leading to potential errors when processing invalid input.
- **Fix**: Added validation to ensure `developers` is a non-empty array; otherwise, the route responds with a 400 error.

## 3. Inefficient Request Handling
- **Problem**: Requests were likely sequential, slowing down response time.
- **Fix**: Used `Promise.all` to fetch all developer data concurrently, improving performance.

## 4. Inadequate Error Handling
- **Problem**: Errors during data fetching were not handled, causing app crashes on failed requests.
- **Fix**: Added `try-catch` blocks around API requests, logging errors and providing fallback responses.

## 5. Code Organization
- **Problem**: The main route was cluttered, with API request logic directly inside it, making it hard to read and maintain.
- **Fix**: Moved GitHub API request logic into a helper function, `fetchDeveloperData`, to improve readability and modularity.
